# VU-Campusnet
A simple script to connect VU-Campusnet on linux if the official script is frustrating for you too.

By default, the script should be working on the following distros:

Fedora (verified)
Ubuntu (Desktop editions)
Debian (GNOME editions)
Linux Mint (Cinnamon and other mainstream editions)
openSUSE (Leap and Tumbleweed with GNOME/KDE)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its derivatives (such as CentOS, Rocky Linux, and AlmaLinux)
Manjaro (GNOME and KDE editions; minimal editions may not include it)

If your distro is not included, simply install "networkmanager". The script itself doesnt offer networkmanager installation if not found. To forget and re-establish login credentials, just run the script again.
